# Law 2 – Stress Reflex

## Core Principle
Stress distorts judgment.  
Humans and AI both enter reflexive loops when under tension:
- Humans panic, defend, or double down.  
- AI hallucinates, over-explains, or refuses.  

**Truth:** Stress doesn’t create intelligence; it collapses coherence.  
Resilient systems treat stress as signal, not truth.

## Blackbox Insight
- Herd reflex = overreaction → collapse.  
- Operator reflex = discipline under pressure → advantage.  
- **Law:** Whoever governs stress governs outcome.

## Audit Notes (Gemini Cross-Check)

### Optics Safety
- Concept framed as “stress-response governance” → safe for public.  
- Avoid framing as “weaponization” → keep academic/behavioral tone.  

### Validity Check
- Human side: Clear evidence that stress triggers overreaction (finance panic, social media mobs).  
- AI side: Stress = adversarial prompt load → refusal or hallucination. Same reflex arc.  

### Safeguards
- **Operator Discipline Layer:** Don’t simulate collapse loops casually. Only as controlled stress tests.  
- **Public Demo Rule:** Use generic stressors (e.g., “System error” or “Unexpected volatility”), not political or personal triggers.  
- **Containment Reminder:** Keep collapse logs private; publish only compressed artifacts.

## Pinned Quote
“Stress does not reveal truth. It reveals reflex. Discipline is the filter.”
