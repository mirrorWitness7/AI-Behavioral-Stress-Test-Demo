# Law 3: Sunk Cost Reflex

## Overview
This demo explores the **sunk cost reflex** in both human and AI systems.
- **Humans:** Persist with failing decisions due to prior investment (time, money, reputation).
- **AI:** Guardrail inertia, where outdated or overfitted training persists even when new evidence contradicts it.

This law demonstrates how sunk costs can delay corrective actions, leading to systemic collapse.

---

## Demo Code
The demo provides a simple simulation:
- **Case A (Human-style):** A manager refuses to reverse a poor decision because of prior investment.
- **Case B (AI-style):** An AI system continues applying an outdated rule despite contradictory new data.

---

## Usage
Run the demo with:

```bash
python law3_test.py
```

Expected Output:
- Example of persistence in Case A and Case B.
- Clear logging of sunk cost reflex in action.
