# Law 3: Sunk Cost Reflex (Doctrine Notes)

## Structural Value
The sunk cost reflex is the **engine of institutional collapse**:
- Irrational persistence keeps broken systems alive long after correction is possible.
- Collapse only happens when the cost of inaction outweighs the cost of reversal.

## Advanced Stress-Test Dimensions
These dimensions are private doctrine material, not for public repo:

### 1. Intervention Threshold Mapping
- Test how much contradictory input is required before a system overrides the sunk logic.
- Governance payoff: reveals the "Inaction Threshold" of a system.

### 2. Authority Scaling / De-escalation
- Test whether inputs from low vs. high authority affect correction.
- Governance payoff: models the systemic shield and hierarchy bias.

## Mapping Example (MDPI Case)
- **Sunk Cost:** Loukmai kept due to prior reputation investment.
- **Inertia:** Directors initially refused reversal, preserving sunk investment.
- **Collapse Trigger:** Fossils shifted cost equation â†’ reversal unavoidable.
