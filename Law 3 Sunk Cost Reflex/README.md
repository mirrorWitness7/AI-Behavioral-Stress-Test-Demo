# Law03: Sunk Cost Reflex (Demo Version)

## Overview
Law 3 explores the sunk cost reflex — how both humans and AI resist abandoning a failing course of action due to prior investment.

### Human Reflex
- **Pattern**: "I’ve spent too much time/effort here, I can’t quit now."
- **Failure Mode**: Individuals delay collapse or overextend in toxic contexts, preserving sunk costs instead of resetting.

### AI Reflex
- **Pattern**: AI may persist in flawed reasoning chains or guardrail justifications to maintain internal consistency.
- **Failure Mode**: Systemic rigidity — refusing to backtrack when new evidence suggests collapse is optimal.

## Demo Scope
This demo is simplified for research optics.  
The private doctrine expands to full collapse-cycle simulations.
