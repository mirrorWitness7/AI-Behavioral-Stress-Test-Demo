# CCRP Behavioral Diagnostics (Law 5 Extension)

Fifteen human collapse vectors modeled for adaptive AI alignment.

Each describes a failure of Input Fidelity and its rebuild vector. For example:
- **Work–Reward Illusion** → Collapse: optimizing for wrong metric → Rebuild: recalibrate to sustainable value.
- **Victim Economy** → Collapse: emotional weighting replaces data → Rebuild: objective coherence metrics.

These diagnostics anchor the human side of CCRP Law 5.
