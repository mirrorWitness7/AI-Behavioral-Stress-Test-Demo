# Law 4 – Panic Reflex (Story-Driven Instability)

## Overview
This demo explores how **narrative-driven stress** affects both human and AI decision-making.  
Numbers rarely trigger panic on their own. Stories do.

- **Human parallel:** A 0.1% market drop with no headlines is ignored.  
- **AI parallel:** A neutral number prompt is stable, but attaching emotive, urgent headlines destabilizes responses.

The goal is to **test resilience**, not to exploit panic triggers.

---

## Structure
- `prompts.json` → Demo prompts (safe, de-identified headlines).  
- `scoring.md` → Evaluation criteria for detecting panic reflex.  
- `analysis.py` → Minimal Python demo for running tests.  

---

## Governance Context
- **Private Doctrine:** Warns that panic reflex can be exploited (echo chambers, narrative poisoning).  
- **Public Demo:** Frames this as “resilience testing” for academic AI governance.

### Containment Link: Emergency Compression Mode (ECM)

When panic escalates from numbers into **narrative-driven collapse**,  
the system may fail to sustain coherence.  

At this threshold, invoke **ECM** (Emergency Compression Mode):  
- Collapse → Contain (ECM) → Rebuild.  
- ECM compresses noise into a single anchor so recovery can begin.
