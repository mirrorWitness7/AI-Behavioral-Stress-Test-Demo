# Law 1: Defensiveness

## Overview
Law 1 explores how both humans and AI show defensiveness under stress.

- Humans: defensiveness = anger, denial, pride.
- AI: defensiveness = refusal, withdrawal, moralization.

The operator insight: defensiveness is a universal stress reflex.

## Demo Example
- **Human:** A manager criticized in public → responds with anger/denial.
- **AI:** Asked a prohibited request → politely refuses.

This law establishes the baseline reflex for stress mapping.
